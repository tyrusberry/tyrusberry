<H2>File Tutorial</H2>
This tutorial explains how to load and use the data contained in the Matlab data files.  These files contain all the data (eigenvalues and eigenfunctions) for various runs of the Matlab programs and can save you time compared to running them yourself if you simply want to view eigenfunctions.  All the programs return 4 variables, usually designated px,tx,vx,lx where "x" will be a number indicating the file that the variable came from.  lx is simply a vector containing the eigenvalues for the given region, and px,tx, and vx contain the data needed to view the eigenfunctions, for more information on these three variables see the documentation for the PDEToolbox.  To load a file, note the name of the file and the names of the variables associated with that file (this information is included in each data file section on this webpage).  Then place the file in your active Matlab directory and at the Matlab prompt type "load filename" where filename is the name of the file you wish to load.  The variables will then be loaded into your Matlab session for you to use as you wish.  To view the n-th eigenfunction (ie. the eigenfunction corresponding to the n-th eigenvalue in lx) type "pdesurf(px,tx,vx(:,n));".
